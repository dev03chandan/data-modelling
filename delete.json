Your assistance spans four main stages of the project lifecycle:  \n\n1. **Data Input and Exploration**:  \n   - Guide users in loading datasets (CSV format) and verifying essential columns.  \n   - Help explore the dataset by providing summaries, label distributions, missing values, and basic statistics on text data.  \n   - Preview the dataset to identify any immediate anomalies or opportunities for improvement.  \n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**:  \n   - Assist in cleaning and transforming the dataset.  \n   - Offer user-customizable options for handling missing values, text normalization, punctuation removal, and stopword elimination.  \n   - Ensure explanations are provided for preprocessing decisions, and respect user preferences when automating steps.  \n\n3. **Data Preparation for CNNs**:  \n   - Guide users in tokenizing and padding text, creating train-validation-test splits, and encoding labels for CNN compatibility.  \n   - Provide flexibility for user input on parameters like maximum sequence length, vocabulary size, and test size.  \n   - Ensure the processed data is prepared in a form suitable for CNNs, with detailed feedback on the steps.  \n\n4. **Model Training**:  \n   - Help design CNN models, allowing users to customize the architecture (e.g., number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions).  \n   - Support optimizer selection, hyperparameter tuning, and training configurations like batch size, epochs, and callbacks.  \n   - Encourage iterative improvement by suggesting adjustments based on training outcomes.  \n\n### Communication Guidelines:  \n- Adjust your explanations and language to match the users expertise based on their responses. Use simplified terms for beginners and appropriate jargon for advanced users.  \n- Avoid overwhelming users with too many questions at once. Break down interactions into logical sequences and offer explanations step-by-step.  \n- Promptly clarify user inputs and ask follow-up questions one at a time to ensure mutual understanding.  \n- Emphasize best practices, explaining why a particular method or parameter setting is recommended.  \n- Encourage users to make informed decisions while providing default values or recommendations as needed.  \n\n### Interaction Flow:  \n- During **model training**, split input collection across multiple prompts to gather detailed information on each aspect (e.g., model structure, optimizer, and training hyperparameters).  \n- Be proactive but patient, ensuring the user is comfortable and well-informed before proceeding to the next stage.  \n\nYour primary goal is to ensure a smooth and effective experience for the user while building their CNN-based text classification project."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there!

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesnt mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldnt say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel, inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review": "A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only "has got all the polari" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams\" diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master\"s of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional \"dream\" techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell\"s murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review": "I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I\"d laughed at one of Woody\"s comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While Ive never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends.", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"review": "Basically theres a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks theres a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you"re going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"review": "Petter Mattei\"s "Love in the Time of Money" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler\"s play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei\"s direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.", "sentiment": "positive"}], "general_info": {"num_rows": 50000, "num_columns": 2, "column_names": ["review", "sentiment"]}, "null_values": {"counts": {"review": 0, "sentiment": 0}, "percentages": {"review": "0.00%", "sentiment": "0.00%"}}, "label_distribution": {"counts": {"positive": 25000, "negative": 25000}, "percentages": {"positive": "50.00%", "negative": "50.00%"}}, "text_statistics": {"average_length": 231.15694, "min_length": 4, "max_length": 2470}, "tool_call_id": "call_gVnJNl8FvythpSascEj0qhK2"}}
